## [Description](#table-of-contents)
This project consists of an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. We used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
First you can clone the repository to your local machine. Then you should run `npm install` to install the necessary packages. You will also need to have your own MongoDB installed and Insomnia or a similar app to test the routes. Start the server by running `npm start`.

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
After installation, navigate to http://localhost:3000/api in your browser or Postman to access the API.  Please refer to the walkthrough video provided below in the "Links" session, for how to use Insomnia to test the routes.

## [Questions](#table-of-contents)
If you have any questions about the functionality of the application or installation, please reach out to me.
